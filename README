Platform:
Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2
IIS7+
Local SQL Server 2008 R2

PowerShell Setup:
1. PowerShell installed/available
2. When executing in PowerShell console, make sure to load all system modules
3. Change execution policy in PowerShell with: Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

IMPORTANT:

Open install.config.
You will need to adjust the settings in install.config accordingly.

1. DefaultRuntimeVersion is set to 4.0, that means you have to have .NET 4 installed.
2. AppPoolIdentity - defaults to NetworkService.
2. InetpubLocation - target location with the Sitecore installation. Should end with "\", ex: "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\"
   The account specified in 'AppPoolIdentity' should have "modify" access over this directory.
   Also, if you have SQL Server service running under another account, make sure that account has "modify" permissions also.

3. TempFolder - make sure it exists locally.
   
4. BaseStorageUrl - specifies the location with 'versions.config' and Sitecore distributives.
   This could either be a CDN, network share or a local file path.

   IMPORTANT:
	- files should be named using the following convention: <majorversion>x<revision>.zip
  	  for example: 641x110720.zip, 650x111123.zip, etc.
	  These ZIP files should have "data", "Databases" and "Website" folders in the root.
	  The ZIP distributives from SDN have slightly different structure, so this should be fixed.
	  See distributive_structure.png
	  
	- there should be versions.config file in the repository describing all versions available.
	  see sample file for more info.
	  
5. Other settings are obvious:
	- LicenseFilePath
	- SQLServerName
	- SQLUserName
	- SQLPassword
	- SQLRuntimeUserName
